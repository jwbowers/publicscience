The campus logo images have been divided into folders for PC and Mac.
Three file formats allow the logo to be reproduced correctly in print and on-screen.

The EPS files are for use in professional page layout and illustration programs such as Adobe's InDesign and Illustrator and Quark XPress. Such programs are used to create documents suitable for reproduction via digital or offset printing processes at a professional printer. PC Adobe software users should set their screen display to high quality to correctly render the transparency of the EPS files.
 
The TIF files are for use in Microsoft Office programs such as Word and PowerPoint and also may be used in professional page layout programs. To make a transparent TIF, open the EPS file in Photoshop and adjust the dimensions and resolution of the image in the "Rasterize Generic EPS Format" window. Make sure a check is in the checkbox next to the "Anti-aliased" and "Constrain Proportions" options.

The GIF files are for use onscreen on Web pages and in presentation programs such as PowerPoint and Keynote. They are not suitable for print reproduction.

After in-depth cross-platform testing in numerous programs, Creative Services does not recommend JPEG, PNG, and BMP file formats for use with the campus logo for a variety of reasons, including quality of rendering, reproduction, transparency support, file size, and color stability.

Word should not be used for professional page layout or desktop publishing and is best suited for processing text that will be imported into professional layout programs. While Word contains templates for print, its ability to perform layout tasks is limited and a professional printer will potentially have problems outputting the resulting files.
