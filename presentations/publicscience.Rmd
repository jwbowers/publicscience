\note{ El año pasado participe en un equipo de social and behavioral scientists
dedicados a utilizar lo que saben del consenso de conocimiento en psicologia,
economia, y el resto de los disciplinas academicas que estan enfocados en
intender el comportamiento del ser humano, en servicio publico --- para mejorar
las politicas publicas del gobierno y mejorar la relacion entre el publico y el
gobierno. }

## Formal Foundation: Executive Order 13707

\note{ El equipo fue fundado formalmente por un order del Presidente Barak
Obama en Septiembre 15, 2015. Y ya hemos producido mas o menos 30 policy
interventions con prueba con experimento aleatorio del campo.}

## SBST Vision and Mission

### SBST Vision
We believe government works best when it's built for people.

### SBST Mission
The Social and Behavioral Sciences Team:

\begin{itemize}
\item Brings diverse scientific expertise to Federal agencies
 \item Applies insights about human behavior to improve Government’s interactions with people
 \item Tests and learns what works using rigorous methods
 \end{itemize}

\note{ Quiero notar que somos parte de un movimiento en el mundo entero que esta empujando al estado a ser mas y mas en servicio del pueblo, de la persona. Comento dos ejemplos: (1) si queremos ayudar a gente que quieren ahorrar para la jubilacion, tenemos que ser consciente de que el ser human descuenta el futuro (a veces, mucho), asi que }

## Behavioral Insights Movement

Behavioral Insights teams are groups of policy advisors who translate (and extend) knowledge from academic disciplinary consensus into public policy.

## Behavioral Insights Movement

\centering\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{biteam.png}

\note{ I also want to highlight the fact that this is a movement: there are teams being
established around the world, at diverse levels of government, all the time.
The general idea behind this movement is two fold: (1) the move to make
governments human-centered, to make public policy that does not assume rational
actors all the time and (2) the growth and maturing of policy relevant theories
and findings from academia, typified by the work of Kahnemann and Tverky in
psychology, but including work in economics and other disciplines.

# Examples of our Work

##  A Positive Effect of Cognitive Availability

\columnsbegin
\column{.6\textwidth}
Roughly 20--30 percent of college-accepted high school graduates
in urban districts fail to matriculate in college in the fall, because they do
not complete required pre-matriculation tasks such as  filling out
course-enrollment forms, taking placement tests, or completing the FAFSA
form.

\medskip

Sending low-income, college-accepted high school graduates personalized text
message reminders to complete required pre-matricula on tasks led 8.6 percent
more students to successfully enroll in college.

## A Null Effect of Social Norms

## Other Projects

Some other projects, including some in progress:

 - Only 44% of military enrolled in retirement savings. In pilot projects
   involving active choice saw increase by 8%.

 - Increased applications for and take-up of microloans for farmers via
   redesigned communication.

 - Helping people communicate with loan counselors to avoid defaults on student
   loans by providing a committment device (pre-scheduled call times).

 - Changing materials and training associated with unemployment benefits (state
   of Oregon).

 Also some projects not involving testing: on <http://vote.gov>, on
 the handbook for water safety for the EPA in Flint, on the Bureau of Prison's
 Re-Entry Handbook, training USAID missions in behavioral approaches to policy
 creation.

## Challenges for the government and public: Using Behavioral Approaches to Avoid Structural Change

## Challenges for science: Political capture.


## Scientific Integrity and Government for Humans

Our vision of a human centered government means that we serve and empower the public and our agency partners.

\bigskip

We serve and empower the public and agency partners by doing and teaching excellent and high integrity science (empirical/experimental/observational science, humility in the face of uncertainty, impersonal techniques for learning from observation, etc\ldots).


# Plan, Execute, and Communicate Good Science

## How to do excellent science?

### Challenge
"Excellent science" changes over time, place, and discipline.

### Approaches

(* means we are already doing something like this)

\begin{itemize}
\item Publicize all results --- confirming, null* or counter to our or any agencies policy priors.
\item Publish in Peer Reviewed Places. *
\item Register all designs that we run to avoid the file drawer problem. *
\item Pre-analysis plans to avoid concerns about fishing and p-hacking. *
\item Re-analysis (from scratch) of results. *
\item Reproducible code to enable public scrutiny and learning (by others, by us) *
\item Follow (and improve) the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) *
\end{itemize}

**We are already pursuing more excellent scientific practices than most social and behavioral scientists.**

# Pursue a Government built for Humans

## Tactics for creating a human centered government


 1. Apply the insights and tools of behavioral and social science following
    excellent scientific principles.

 2. Choose projects which have direct payoff with respect to the health and
    benefits of individual members of the public.

 3. Enhance the reputation of the team: (We should keep hearing people say,
    "Oh, the SBST! I love y'all!" or "I've hear such great things about your
    team!")


## The Threat of Political Capture (Real or Imagined)

**Imagined Capture** deprives us of invitations to collaborate with the right kinds of people in the agencies and academia.

\medskip

**Real Capture** deprives us of invitations to collaborate with the right kinds of people in the agencies and academia **and** deprives us of the ability to learn and teach about what works and what doesn't.

## A new tactic: Openness.

If we show X works in the federal government, we may see X implemented in Urbana, Illinois. (so we **serve the public twice** for one study if the public can know about the study and can implement and analyze the study.)

\medskip

Rather than make extra teaching and outreach materials, we can work in
public as much as possible (following 18F which also cares about a human centered
government)^[https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/1-build-in-the-open/ and
    <https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/31/working-in-public-from-day-1/>]


\medskip

If we model openness, then we have the opportunity to learn from the new groups
and from people not directly involved in our team or the broader
multidisciplinary effort. For example, people around the world fix bugs in 18F's code for
free when they copy the code for their own use.

\medskip

Openness also counteracts the threat of political capture.
