## SBST Vision and Mission

### SBST Vision
We believe government works best when it's built for people.

### SBST Mission
The Social and Behavioral Sciences Team:

\begin{itemize}
\item Brings diverse scientific expertise to Federal agencies
 \item Applies insights about human behavior to improve Government’s interactions with people
 \item Tests and learns what works using rigorous methods
 \end{itemize}


## Scientific Integrity and Government for Humans

Our vision of a human centered government means that we serve and empower the public and our agency partners.

\bigskip

We serve and empower the public and agency partners by doing and teaching excellent and high integrity science (empirical/experimental/observational science, humility in the face of uncertainty, impersonal techniques for learning from observation, etc\ldots).


# Plan, Execute, and Communicate Good Science

## How to do excellent science?

### Challenge
"Excellent science" changes over time, place, and discipline.

### Approaches

(* means we are already doing something like this)

\begin{itemize}
\item Publicize all results --- confirming, null* or counter to our or any agencies policy priors.
\item Publish in Peer Reviewed Places. *
\item Register all designs that we run to avoid the file drawer problem. *
\item Pre-analysis plans to avoid concerns about fishing and p-hacking. *
\item Re-analysis (from scratch) of results. *
\item Reproducible code to enable public scrutiny and learning (by others, by us) *
\item Follow (and improve) the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) *
\end{itemize}

**We are already pursuing more excellent scientific practices than most social and behavioral scientists.**

# Pursue a Government built for Humans

## Tactics for creating a human centered government


 1. Apply the insights and tools of behavioral and social science following
    excellent scientific principles.

 2. Choose projects which have direct payoff with respect to the health and
    benefits of individual members of the public.

 3. Enhance the reputation of the team: (We should keep hearing people say,
    "Oh, the SBST! I love y'all!" or "I've hear such great things about your
    team!")


## The Threat of Political Capture (Real or Imagined)

**Imagined Capture** deprives us of invitations to collaborate with the right kinds of people in the agencies and academia.

\medskip

**Real Capture** deprives us of invitations to collaborate with the right kinds of people in the agencies and academia **and** deprives us of the ability to learn and teach about what works and what doesn't.

## A new tactic: Openness.

If we show X works in the federal government, we may see X implemented in Urbana, Illinois. (so we **serve the public twice** for one study if the public can know about the study and can implement and analyze the study.)

\medskip

Rather than make extra teaching and outreach materials, we can work in
public as much as possible (following 18F which also cares about a human centered
government)^[https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/1-build-in-the-open/ and 
    <https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/31/working-in-public-from-day-1/>]


\medskip

If we model openness, then we have the opportunity to learn from the new groups
and from people not directly involved in our team or the broader
multidisciplinary effort. For example, people around the world fix bugs in 18F's code for
free when they copy the code for their own use.

\medskip

Openness also counteracts the threat of political capture.
